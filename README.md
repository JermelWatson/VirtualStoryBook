# VirtualStoryBook
This project is a fun and interactive HTML/CSS/JavaScript flipbook that mimics the feel of turning pages in a physical book using a single card that rotates 360° with each navigation click. Each “page” features a full-screen background, image, title, and text, allowing for a dynamic storytelling experience.
